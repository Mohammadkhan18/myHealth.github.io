<h2 class="h2 my-5">1.Hanging Leg Raises</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1075/8446/files/exercise-21.jpg?0" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
<p>Hanging leg raises train your abs and your hip flexors. The exercise can be made easier by bending your knees, called hanging knee raises, and you can make it heavier by using ankle weights or by holding a small dumbbell between your feet.</p>
<p>Both primary hip flexors—the sartorius and the iliopsoas—work hard during hanging leg raises. The longest muscle in the body, the sartorius assists with hip and knee flexion. The iliopsoas flexes the hip to draw the thighs to the trunk, aids in side bending, and flexes the lumbar spine.1

    The rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, pectineus, and adductor longus are synergistic muscles that are also activated during the hanging leg raise. The stabilizing abdominal muscles during this exercise are the rectus abdominus and the obliques.</p>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">2.Weighted Twist</h2>

<p>Target muscles: Internal and External Obliques</p>
<p>Sit on the floor with your knees bent, and lock your feet under something stable.
    Grasp a weight plate in both hands.
    Lean backward until your torso and thighs create a v-shape.</p>

     <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffitnessvolt.com%2Fcross-body-crunch%2F&psig=AOvVaw1CoYzT0actHr8twSSswvET&ust=1674377992343000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCPiHqqWm2PwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABA9" class="rounded ms-5" width="100%" height="auto">
     <p>At this point in your lower abs workout, you should be feeling the burn. The second last exercise is a real killer — starfish crunches. This move works both your upper and lower abs, as you’re bringing your legs and torso up. It also works the obliques with both the crossover motion and the need to stabilize your trunk due to the high level of movement.</p>
     <p>Lie flat on your back and bend your knees about 60 degrees. Make sure your feet are flat on the floor and place your hands loosely behind your head. Do not clinch your hands together. This will be your starting position. Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time.

        Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Try to bring your shoulder up toward your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow. Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee. Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Dumbbell Side Bend</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/64/11/25/6411250ed0f5a546a46a2a5bfa9ff2d7.jpg" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
        <p>The dumbbell side bend is an old-school exercise used to beef up the oblique muscles to improve the appearance of the midsection. Learn how to do this exercise with tips, variations, and more.</p>
        <p>The oblique muscles are located on either side of the rectus abdominis or six-pack abs. There are essentially two parts that make up this muscle: external and internal obliques. The internal obliques lie deep to the external obliques and above the transverse abdominis. 

            The obliques help to rotate and laterally flex the trunk and are essential for stabilization and compressing the contents of the core or midsection. </p>

            <h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Kneeling Cable Crunch</h2>
            <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jasestuart.com%2Fkneeling-cable-crunch&psig=AOvVaw1iytFfhDCrUJB2WMNxWQk7&ust=1674378518625000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCNjLhqCo2PwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAW" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img"width="100%" height="auto">
            <p>The kneeling cable crunch is a very effective isolation exercise for the abdominal and core muscles. It’s a great movement for beginners and advanced lifers since you can choose the resistance to work with during the exercise.</p>
            <p>Now, it’s important to have proper form during the kneeling cable crunch as you don’t want to overextend the core muscles, especially if they’re not warmed up properly. This can cause discomfort below the belly button and it’s not fun when this happens.</p>
