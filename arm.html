            <p>EZ bar: Frankly, there’s no other piece of equipment that can substitute the EZ bar, which makes this the only suitable equipment for this type of bicep variation. Unless, of course, you can mimic the same structure on a piece of steel.
                Arm Blaster: Allows you to concentrate on and isolate bicep muscles, thus, keeping a perfect form for the best hypertrophic response, aka size gains.</p>
            <p>Let’s face it, working on your curls, no matter how mediocre it feels, can improve your pulling strength and performance by a huge chunk. Since this movement requires the majority of your arms to move, performing EZ curls also activate your hands, wrists, and forearms. This newly established strength can then be passed on to other pulling exercises that require bicep power.</p>

            <p>The biceps cable curl is an isolation exercise for the biceps muscles in the upper arm. The pulling action is performed with a cable machine and is suitable for beginners. This exercise can be used as part of an upper-body muscle-building program.</p>
            <p>The primary target of the cable curl is the biceps brachii muscle. This is the muscle that flexes the elbow and connects the scapula with the radius of the forearm.1

                Synergistic muscles worked during the cable curl are the brachialis and brachioradialis, also used when flexing the elbow. Stabilizing muscles come into play in the shoulder and upper back—namely, the anterior deltoid, trapezius, and levator scapulae. Wrist flexors are used as well</p>

<p>Everyone wants to have big, strong and well-shaped biceps. Big biceps not only make you look good, but also give you a unique type of self-confidence. To get those thick biceps muscles, one of the most effective exercises is the dumbbell preacher curl.

    There are now different types of curls using different equipment and weights, but they all have one goal, which is to target the biceps and make them grow big and in a curved shape.</p>
    <p>Helps you perform the exercise correctly and in perfect body alignment
        The preacher machine curl helps isolate the muscles of the upper and lower arms, focusing all of the force goes into the biceps muscles you planned to develop to build required strength.
        Not only does it develop greater strength arms, but it also ensures that you avoid a higher risk of any injuries or soreness that can raise in your elbow joints.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Spider Curl</h2>

        <p>Spider curls are a sort of curl in which you raise your chest on a bench to work out the short head of the bicep muscle. A great benefit of this type of curl is that by removing your bodyweight from the equation, you lose any support from the momentum you may have had during your bicep curls.</p>
        <p>Lifters who perform the same exercises repeatedly will work the muscles in the same way. This is why some people reach a plateau and can not seem to get their biceps to get much larger, even while lifting greater weights. If this describes you, then alternative workouts may provide greater results. Exercises such as the spider curl will help to fill up the biceps and increase muscular growth.</p>

        <p>As far as cool exercise names go, the skull crusher has one of the best. It certainly sounds more intimidating than the squat, for instance. And while we love exercises that sound awesome, we also need them to yield big muscle gains. The good news is that the skull crusher lives up to its name, and when done correctly, will help sculpt the horseshoe-shaped triceps we're all striving for.</p>
        <p>Triceps exercises like kickbacks are great for adding finesse to your workout, but they simply don't allow for heavy loads. If you look at the biomechanics, you notice that the load is far from the elbow and shoulder joints during tricep kickbacks.       </p>

         <p>Enhance Upper Arms Strength
            Overhead dumbbell triceps extension trains all three heads of your biceps, which helps you become stronger. Because of this, you develop better sports performance and increased upper body strength, allowing you to use heavier weights when working out. </p>

            <h2 class="h2 my-5">3.Rope Pushdown</h2>
            <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.5t9KY8T_kycIRjkMttYp8gHaFs?pid=ImgDet&w=768&h=591&rs=1" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
            <p>The overhead tricep extension, also called dumbbell overhead tricep extension, is an excellent isolation exercise that targets the muscles on the back of your upper arms (triceps). Although it’s not the most convenient way to engage your triceps, overhead tricep extensions allow you to increase your strength, lessen the stress on your wrists, and improve your posture.

                The triceps account for two-thirds of your upper arm muscle mass. And if you want to achieve awesome muscle gains, isolating the triceps with an overhead extension movement shouldn’t fall out of your routine. Moreover, the action also recruits your shoulders to improve stability and activates your core as secondary muscles. </p>
            <p>Starting Position: Attach a rope attachment to the upper part of a cable machine. Hold the rope with your hands facing each other.

                Form: Exhale and pull the rope down towards your waist. Hold for a brief moment and then slowly return to the starting position.</p>
                <p>The cable rope pushdown is an effective exercise that targets the triceps muscles. The cables provide a constant tension that really challenges the triceps through the entire range of motion. And the cables really help you get a good burn or pump in the back of the arms.</p>

        <p>Chest dips work the entire upper body, and really give you that hormonal boost you need to grow muscle, tone your chest and lose those man boobs. They work your arms, your shoulders, your chest and your upper back.</p>
        <p>When it comes to both performance and sculpting your body through muscle-growth and hormonal stimulation, bodyweight exercises always come on top.</p>
