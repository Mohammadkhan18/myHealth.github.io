<bLockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press</p>
    <p>Two styles of deadlift are commonly used in competition settings: the sumo deadlift and the conventional (or standard) deadlift. While both of these styles are permitted under the rules of powerlifting competition, only the conventional stance is used in strongman deadlifting contests</p>
    <li>3 Sets X 6-8 Reps</li>

    <h2 class="h2 my-5">2.Pull Ups</h2>
    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/supersoldierproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pull-up-newsletter-1.jpg?fit=500%2C281&ssl=1" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
    <p>The pullup exercise is one of the most overlooked exercises for building upper body, back, and core strength. It requires a chin-up bar, which can be freestanding or you can purchase a simple doorway bar. The traditional pullup uses an overhand grip on the bar, while the chin-up is a variation that generally uses an underhand grip. If you are new to pullups, there are many modified versions that can be used to build the strength needed to perform them. Pullups can be part of an upper body strength workout or a circuit training workout.</p>
    <p>The pullup primarily targets the latissimus dorsi (lats) which is the large back muscle behind your arms, but it also works most of your chest, upper back, and shoulder muscles. Your abs are involved in stabilizing you as well. Strengthening your upper body will help you everyday tasks and in achieving good posture.</p>

    <h2 class="h2 my-5">3.Barbell Row</h2>
    <img src="https://davidblyth.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/00271301-Barbell-Bent-Over-Row_Back-FIX_1080.gif" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
    <p>The barbell row is a two-step move. You lift the barbell from the ground and then angle your chest parallel to the ground so you’re slightly bent over. Then, you lift and lower the barbell in a series of reps. Ideally, a trainer watches your form and coaches you through the exercise, but you don’t need a direct spotter as you do on the bench press or for a barbell squat. </p>
    <p>The barbell row works your upper body, and it’s one of the best movements for building a strong back. It works a few muscles called agonist, stabilizer, and synergist muscles. 

        Agonist muscles, also called primer movers, are the major muscles that drive movement, while synergists are helpers that stabilize muscles during the movement.</p>
     <li>3 Sets X 8 Reps</li>
     
     <h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Seated Cable Row</h2>
     <img src="https://www.fitnessandbeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Seated-widebar-cable-row-muscle.png" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
     <p>The seated cable row is one of the best movements you can do if you're aiming towards developing a stronger back. It’s a functional movement that’ll help you out in everyday life while also helping to prevent back strains and injuries. And if you’re looking to improve your other, heavier lifts, then the seated cable row is a terrific supplementary movement to the deadlift and squat.</p>
     <p>The importance of a strong back isn’t a secret to anyone, but that doesn’t mean everyone focuses on it as much as their more superficial muscles, such as the biceps or pecs. But if you want a powerful and confident looking upper body, know that the back is absolutely essential in pulling that off. </p>
     <li>3 Sets X 10 Reps</li>

     <h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Lat Pulldown</h2>
     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.4a46c995bbb1deaab5cb4fe1e86b46a4?rik=Lm3F4kEEtCU4cQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fgym.training%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2018%2f10%2fwide-grip-lat-pulldown-1024x797.png&ehk=RCrcGebPBxDbcPppkjnEAhrL9HzFxmPu%2f7klWWL2Vc8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
     <p>It’s a staple for those wanting to increase the mass of their back muscles and work on achieving the V-shaped back that is desired by bodybuilders, weightlifters, and fitness enthusiasts alike.</p>
     <p>This exercise is an excellent substitute for pullups or chinups if you have difficulty performing these exercises or if you’re training to get there.

        The lat pulldown activates some of the same muscles as doing a pullup, although to a lesser extent (1).
        
        Also, because you’re seated during the lat pulldown, you can use your hip flexors and abdominals to stabilize your body as you perform it. In fact, one older study found that the pulldown recruited the abdominals more than the pullup did</p>

     <h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Dumbbell Row</h2>
     <img src="https://healthjade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dumbbell-Row.jpg" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
     <p>The single-arm dumbbell row is one of those exercises that won’t go out of style. It’s simple as heck to do — you literally kneel on a bench and row your arm to your side — and it requires just a dumbbell to load the movement. It’s also a unilateral exercise, meaning it trains one side of your body at a time. Single-arm moves help to even out muscular imbalances and burn more calories over time since you’re essentially doubling up your workload. </p>
     <p>The dumbbell row is a key back-building exercise for lifters, athletes, and general fitness goers alike. You can do dumbbell rows to develop back strength and muscle hypertrophy, with additional benefits of increased grip and biceps development when done in higher training volumes.</p>
     <li>3 Sets X 8 Reps</li>

     <h2 class="h2 my-5">6.V-Bar Pulldown</h2>
     <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55e406fbe4b0b03c5e7543ae/t/58feaab4725e25e05ced88e9/1493084858692/Close+Grip+V-Bar+Pulldown" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
     <p>Simply put, it’s a type of pulldown where we use a particular handle called a v bar. During a pulldown, we’re usually seated (but we can stand or kneel) whilst we pull a weight down, from above us, using a cable machine</p>
     <p>Our lats work best when pulling our elbows from in front of us, rather than out to the sides like a wide-grip pull-up. This is why this variation of the pulldown is so adept at targeting our lats as it’s very difficult for our elbows to flair out whilst moving a considerable weight. If our elbows could flair out, we would recruit more rear delt.</p>
