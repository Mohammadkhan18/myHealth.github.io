<p>The push-up (sometimes called a press-up in British English) is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position. By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole.[1] Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military physical training. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, and some martial arts disciplines.</p>

        <p>Being a compound exercise, the barbell bench press is capable of activating a large number of muscle groups in a simultaneous manner, though the capacity in which these muscles are recruited differs between each one.</p>
        <P>Muscle groups such as the pectorals, triceps brachii, and the anterior head of the deltoids act as the primary source of force throughout the entirety of a barbell bench press repetition, thereby allowing them to be referred to as the primary mover muscles.</P>

        <p>The incline barbell bench press is among the most popular gym exercises and for good reason. The movement strengthens your chest, shoulders, and triceps when done correctly. Plus, thanks to the torso angle, the incline press emphasizes the clavicular (upper) portion of your chest, leading to more balanced development.</p>
        <p>Doing the incline press with a barbell is beneficial because it allows you to overload your muscles with more weight, causing greater mechanical tension for growth (1). Aside from building muscle, the barbell incline press develops your pressing strength, improving sports performance and making everyday tasks more accessible.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Dumbbell Bench Press</h2>

        <p>The dumbbell bench press is a compound movement and activates multiple muscle groups such as the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and your triceps. Additionally, the dumbbell bench press, can improve muscular imbalances, correct posture, improve mobility, increase core strength, and help improve total upper body strength.</p>
        <p>The dumbbell bench press is perhaps one of the most tried and true strength training movements, that will build more muscle mass and strength. Dumbbells are independent of on another, therefore the dumbbell bench press can improve posture, build better core strength and core stability, as well as correct muscular imbalance.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Peckdeck Fly</h2>

        <p>The pec deck machine maintains constant and equal tension throughout the exercise. Since the weight, is always pulling down on the lever arms you are moving. Other flys that use the gravity of cables tension do not isolate your Pectoralis Major like the pec deck. For example in the down position for cable flyes, the tension of the cable is pulling your arms away from your body. Similarly with the dumbbell fly when your arms are straight above you, gravity is pushing them against your arms. But with the pec deck provides constant rotation force against your Pectoralis Major.</p>
        <p>Like most exercises, the setup is very important. The pec deck fly machine is adjustable. Although not every pec deck machine can the arms be adjusted, all will likely have a seat adjustment. Adjusting the height of the seat is important for your shoulders and to prevent injuries. You want your elbows to be slightly lower than your shoulders and in line with your chest. Because if your elbows are too high you are putting unnecessary tension on your shoulders.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 my-5">6.Dumbbell Incline Fly</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/18/3b/0c183bfa4885ab92658c812e2a93e690.png" class="rounded" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
        <p>The incline dumbbell fly targets the upper pectorals and is a great way to improve chest development. The shoulders play a secondary role, while the triceps stabilize the movement. Although the flat bench fly benefits the pectoralis major, the incline fly goes one step further to isolate the upper part of this muscle.</p>
        <p>The fly machine is ideal for increasing chest strength and muscle mass by targeting the pectoralis muscles. You have two sets of pectoral muscles on each side of the front of your chest: the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor.</p>

        <p>Chest dips work the entire upper body, and really give you that hormonal boost you need to grow muscle, tone your chest and lose those man boobs. They work your arms, your shoulders, your chest and your upper back.</p>
        <p>When it comes to both performance and sculpting your body through muscle-growth and hormonal stimulation, bodyweight exercises always come on top.</p>
