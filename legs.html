                    <img src="https://www.gymguider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Squat-600x364.png" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p>The quadriceps extend your knee joint and, as a result, are the prime mover in every form of squat you perform. The deeper you sit into the squat posture, the more your knee bends. As such, you’ll generally get more quad engagement the deeper you squat, so don’t skimp out on your depth. </p>
                    <p>The back squat, like the deadlift, builds serious leg and back strength as it engages all major muscles in your legs — big and small — and allows you to load the body with significantly more weight than what can be achieved with other moves like lunges, goblet squats, and leg extensions. </p>
                    <li>3 Sets X 10 Reps</li>

                    <h2 class="h2 my-5">2.Lunges</h2>
                    <img src="https://fitnessvolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lunges-746x420.jpg" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p>The lunge is a fundamental, lower body compound exercise performed to enhance overall leg strength, endurance, and development. The lunge is technically a variation of the squat, which is one of the primary movement patterns that help develop total body strength and stability and focus exclusively on lower body muscles.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the lunge is a fundamental movement that everyone should master, especially if you’re familiar with the squat and looking for a good progression. Lunges are powered by the quads and hamstrings, as well as adductors and abductors – the primary muscles of leg movement. The lunge requires strength, balance, and coordination, which is why we suggest you start with the squat and progress from there.</p>

                    <img src="https://menspower.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/barbell-romanian-deadlift.gif" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p>The Romanian deadlift is an exercise that can be used to develop proper hip health and joint actions, muscle growth (hypertrophy), strength, and muscular endurance. It’s a movement used by weightlifters, powerlifters, and other athletes to develop strength and mass in the posterior chain.</p>
                    <p>The Romanian deadlift targets the hamstrings (discussed above in the muscles worked section), which can help increase muscle mass (hypertrophy). Increased hamstring hypertrophy can lead to increased muscle size, strength, power application, and sports performance.</p>
                    <li>3 Sets X 8-12 Reps</li>

                    <h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Hip Thrust</h2>
                    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ca/f9/b6/caf9b6cebd7e0f82f5900654dcea5e59.jpg" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p>The hip thrust, sometimes called the hip thruster, effectively trains lower body muscles, especially the gluteus maximus. Simply put; the hip thrust is where you’ll place your upper back on a flat bench with your feet on the ground, knees bent, and your butt close to the floor, then you’ll contract your glutes and other muscles to lift your hips upwards until your hips are parallel with the floor. Most likely, you’ve seen people doing the hip thrust in your social media feeds as this once relatively obscure exercise has gone mainstream.</p>
                    <p>Perfect Hypertrophy & Strength Exercise: Hip thrusts are ideal as a muscle-building exercise for the glutes. With this exercise, you can work through strength and power rep ranges and hypertrophy rep ranges without needing a spotter. Once you’re able to find the best body positioning for yourself, then you’ll be able to go as hard as you can trying to get those gains.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Calf Raises</h2>
                    <img src="https://fitnessvolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dumbbell-standing-calf-raise--750x689.jpg" class="rounded ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p>You may not think about your calf muscles regularly, but you use them every day when you stand or move around. They're important for overall balance as well as ankle stability, so having strong calves can help you exercise (or even walk across the street) more effectively, without constantly worrying about hurting yourself.</p>
                    <p>Training your calves is important because of the wide use of those muscles, including during walking, running, jumping, and moving your body during functional movements. “Your calves are an extremely powerful and tough muscle group that propels you forward and raises your entire body many times a day when you walk,” says Batt. “Training your calves is particularly important to build calf strength, endurance, and explosiveness. It’s great for improving ankle stability and overall balance. Calf raises are also excellent for stretching the plantar muscles of the foot and making it more supple.”</p>
                    <li>3 Sets X 10-15 Reps</li>

                    <p>For an effective leg day exercise that requires minimal equipment and engages multiple areas of the body, a hamstring curl is one of the best moves out there. Using a single dumbbell to fire up the glutes and strengthen the legs, this move can fit within any workout—from a quick 20-minute sweat session to a dedicated lower-body split. Here's how to do hamstring curls at home, a more challenging modification, and some tips for making the most of this exercise.</p>
