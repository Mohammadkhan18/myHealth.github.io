<p>Fixed resistance means that the pattern of motion you take when using the machine is completely fixed. You can’t control how you move the weight; you just follow the motion that the machine allows. This makes it different from using free weights, where the way you move them is up to you.</p>
<p>Using the machine instead of the free weights helps you to isolate the deltoid muscles. This means that you’re removing the need of your core to support you during the exercise, and most of the demand falls on your shoulder muscles.</p>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">2.Upright Barbell Row</h2>

<p>The Upright Barbell Row is an exercise for the development of the shoulders and trapezius muscles. It is fundamental a weight lifting shoulder exercise performed while standing, holding a weight hanging down in the hands and lifting it straight up to the collarbone.</p>
<p>Utility: Basic (A regular exercise that can place higher absolute intensity on muscles exercised relative to auxiliary lifts. Basic exercises tend to be gravity-dependent, and they have inclusion or shift in resistance through multiple muscle group. Throughout the range of motion the muscles that are engaged will change (e.g., bench press: front deltoid to pectoralis major to triceps). These exercises have a natural transfer of torsion force to compression force (e.g., lockout on squats, bench press, etc.) or tension force (e.g., the extension of arm curl) to the bone(s) and joint(s) during full range of motion).</p>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">3.Bent Over Raises</h2>

<p>Simply put, bent over lateral raises is a weight lifting workout that puts your rear deltoids at work. Not only the rear deltoids, bent over lateral raises, also activates several muscle groups in the body that ultimately increase strength and hypertrophy. Rear deltoids are muscles found at the back and are small in size. So, you can incorporate the workout in the upper/lower split routine easily.</p>
<p>The focus of bent-over lateral raises on the rear deltoids helps strengthen, tone, and stabilize the upper body in a synchronized manner. Although mostly safe for everyone, you must consult a professional trainer or doctor if you have any injuries or underlying medical concerns. But once you stay thorough with the bent-over lateral raises, you will gradually realize how it safeguards you from injuries, eases the daily pull, push, and overhead movements, improving your athletic performance. Consider working with a fitness expert before adding bent-over lateral raises.</p>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">4.Front Raises</h2>

<p>The dumbbell front raise is a strength training exercise, which stimulates the front, or anterior deltoid. This movement is key for strong muscle development in the shoulders. Your anterior delts can be stimulated and activated through several shoulder movement variations, however the front raise, is one of the most effective to isolate the anterior deltoid. Conventionally performed with dumbbells, the front raise can be done with a barbell, ez bar, or plate. You can also change variables, by making this a dual exercise or bilateral, or single-arm or unilateral.  </p>
<p>Front raises are easily one of the most effective, and best isolation movements for more strength and size. If you want bigger more well-defined shoulders then the front raise deserves a spot in your training program.</p>
<li>3 Sets X 10 Reps</li>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">5.Side Lateral Raises </h2>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.9V3ZHgleyXsl_LqbGxEJoQHaFp?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" class="rounde ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
<p>When doing side lateral raises the deltoids and supraspinatus are primarily used.

    This exercise is a great addition to any upper body workout and strengthens the shoulder muscles. If you want to find out more about optimal workouts for your upper body, have a look at our pages on back training and chest exercises.</p>
    <p>
        Pick up both dumbbells. First stretch your arms against your body and then bend your elbows slightly. Bend your upper body slightly forward. Now raise your arms to the sides and bring them to about a 90 ° angle so that your elbows and hands are about shoulder height. Try to hold the weight for at least a second. Then slowly lower your arms back towards the starting position.</p>

<h2 class="h2 my-5">6.Shrugs</h2>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/62/02/8e6202220cbc38ec12ac2098d54f66e0.png" class="rounde ms-5" alt="img" width="100%" height="auto">
<p>The main muscles that shoulder shrugs target are the trapezius muscles. These muscles are located on either side of your neck. They control the movement of your shoulder blades as well as your upper back and neck.

    When these muscles are strengthened through exercise, you will have an easier time maintaining proper posture. A strong trapezius pulls your shoulders back and helps stabilize your neck and upper back.</p>
    <p>Shoulder shrugs look simple — and that’s because they are. There aren’t a lot of steps or instructions to follow. But there is some safety protocol to be aware of when you try this exercise.

        Never roll your shoulders when you’re doing a shoulder shrug. This also applies to dumbbell shrugs performed with weights or resistance bands. Make sure you carefully lift your shoulders up before dropping them back down in the same vertical direction.</p>
